Certainly! Given the goal of retiring in 25 years, it's important to focus on a balanced approach that offers growth potential while managing risk. Here's a straightforward recommendation:

**Portfolio Composition:**
- **50% VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)**: Provides exposure to the 500 largest U.S. companies, offering a solid foundation of established, diversified stocks.
- **30% QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF)**: Focuses on the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100, providing higher growth potential through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies.
- **20% SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)**: Another S&P 500 ETF that can serve as a stabilizer with broad market exposure, adding a layer of diversification to balance out the portfolio.

**Rationale:**
- **Diversification**: This blend ensures diversification across various sectors, primarily through VOO and SPY, while also capturing the growth potential of the tech sector with QQQ.
- **Growth and Stability**: The combination of VOO and SPY provides a stable core of large-cap U.S. equities, while QQQ offers higher growth prospects, albeit with more volatility.
- **Risk Management**: The majority allocation (70%) to broad market indices (VOO and SPY) helps in managing risk over the long term, complemented by the 30% in QQQ for growth.

This portfolio aims to balance growth and risk, making it suitable for a long-term investment horizon such as 25 years. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing the portfolio is advisable to ensure alignment with retirement goals.
